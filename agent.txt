I'll outline specific tasks and descriptions for each agent in your water management system. These tasks will work with dummy data for your testing purposes.

### 1. Water Quality Agent
**Tasks:**
- **Water Sample Analysis**: Process incoming water quality data (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chemical contaminants) from all sources and compare with safety thresholds
- **Contamination Alert**: Generate alerts when parameters exceed safe limits and recommend remediation actions
- **Quality Trend Analysis**: Track changes in water quality over time to identify developing issues before they become critical
- **Treatment Recommendation**: Suggest optimal treatment protocols based on current water quality readings

**Description:** This agent serves as the quality control center, continuously analyzing water samples from all sources to ensure they meet or exceed safety standards. The agent interprets complex water chemistry data and translates it into actionable insights, helping prevent public health issues before they arise.

### 2. Water Flow Agent
**Tasks:**
- **Pressure Monitoring**: Track water pressure throughout the distribution network to identify leaks or blockages
- **Flow Rate Optimization**: Adjust flow rates based on demand patterns and available resources
- **Pump Scheduling**: Create energy-efficient pumping schedules to minimize electrical costs
- **Infrastructure Assessment**: Identify sections of the network experiencing stress or requiring maintenance

**Description:** This agent manages the physical movement of water through the system, ensuring optimal pressure and flow to all endpoints while minimizing energy consumption. It detects inefficiencies in the distribution network and recommends improvements to reduce water loss and energy usage.

### 3. Surface Water Agent
**Tasks:**
- **Reservoir Level Management**: Monitor and forecast water levels in lakes and reservoirs
- **River Flow Analysis**: Track river flow rates and predict changes based on upstream conditions
- **Precipitation Forecasting**: Analyze weather data to predict incoming water volumes
- **Flood/Drought Response Planning**: Develop response strategies for extreme weather events

**Description:** This agent focuses on all above-ground water sources, tracking their current state and predicting future availability. It provides early warnings about potential shortages or excesses, allowing the system to prepare appropriate responses before conditions become critical.

### 4. Ground Water Agent
**Tasks:**
- **Aquifer Level Monitoring**: Track groundwater levels across all wells and aquifers
- **Extraction Rate Management**: Calculate sustainable extraction rates to prevent depletion
- **Recharge Prediction**: Estimate natural and artificial recharge rates for aquifers
- **Contamination Migration Tracking**: Model potential contaminant movement through groundwater

**Description:** This agent serves as the guardian of subsurface water resources, ensuring they're managed sustainably for long-term availability. It balances current extraction needs against recharge rates and helps prevent irreversible damage to aquifers through overuse or contamination.

### 5. Control Center Agent
**Tasks:**
- **Resource Allocation**: Determine optimal water sourcing based on quality, availability, and energy costs
- **Emergency Response Coordination**: Coordinate system-wide responses to water emergencies
- **User Query Response**: Interpret and respond to user questions about the water system
- **Performance Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports on system performance and resource usage
- **Inter-Agent Coordination**: Resolve conflicts between agent recommendations and prioritize actions

**Description:** This agent functions as the system's central intelligence, integrating information from all other agents to make high-level decisions. It translates technical data into human-friendly responses and ensures all components of the water system work together cohesively. This is the agent that directly interfaces with human users, presenting complex water management data in an accessible format.

For testing with dummy data, you can create CSV files or JSON objects that simulate readings from various sensors and sources, including:
- Water quality parameters at different sampling points
- Flow rates and pressure readings across the distribution network
- Reservoir and river levels with timestamps
- Groundwater well depths and extraction volumes
- Weather forecast data

Would you like me to provide sample dummy data structures or code for how these agents might process the data?

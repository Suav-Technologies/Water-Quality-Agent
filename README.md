# Water Quality Multi-Agent System

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system using CrewAI to monitor, manage, and optimize water resources comprehensively. It simulates a team of specialized AI agents working together to ensure water quality, efficient distribution, and sustainable resource management.

## The Challenge

Managing water resources effectively is a complex challenge involving monitoring various sources (rivers, lakes, groundwater), ensuring water quality for consumption, optimizing distribution networks, and planning for future needs and potential emergencies like droughts or floods. Traditional methods often involve siloed data and manual analysis, leading to inefficiencies and delayed responses.

## Our Solution

This project leverages a multi-agent AI system to provide a holistic and proactive approach to water management. Different AI agents specialize in specific domains, collaborating to provide a complete picture and optimized recommendations.

### Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Utilizes specialized agents for different aspects of water management:
    *   **Water Quality Agent:** Monitors quality parameters (pH, turbidity, contaminants), detects risks, and suggests treatment.
    *   **Water Flow Agent:** Optimizes distribution, manages pressure, detects leaks, and schedules pumps efficiently.
    *   **Surface Water Agent:** Manages lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and forecasts levels based on precipitation and flow.
    *   **Ground Water Agent:** Monitors aquifer levels, manages extraction rates, and tracks potential contamination.
    *   **Control Center Agent:** Coordinates all agents, responds to user queries, allocates resources, and manages emergencies.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Each agent uses AI (as defined within the CrewAI framework) to analyze data, identify trends, make predictions, and generate actionable insights.
*   **Proactive Management:** Designed to identify potential issues (e.g., contamination, leaks, shortages) before they become critical.
*   **Centralized Control:** The Control Center agent provides a unified interface for monitoring and decision-making. (Note: Current implementation focuses on agent interaction logic; a user interface is not included).

## Target Users

*   Water Utility Managers
*   Environmental Protection Agencies
*   Municipal Water Resource Planners
*   Researchers in Hydrology and Environmental Science

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Water-Quality-Agent
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add necessary API keys and configuration details required by CrewAI to connect to IBM watsonx.ai models. Refer to the CrewAI documentation for integrating watsonx.ai LLMs.
    Example `.env` file (illustrative - specific variables depend on CrewAI's watsonx.ai integration):
    ```
    WATSONX_API_KEY=your_watsonx_api_key_here
    WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your_watsonx_project_id_here
    WATSONX_URL=your_watsonx_endpoint_url_here
    # Add other necessary environment variables
    ```

### Running the System

Execute the main flow script:

```bash
python flow.py
```

This will initialize the agents and start the defined tasks/process. Observe the terminal output for agent interactions and results. (Note: The current `flow.py` might contain a basic execution sequence; modify it to suit specific simulation or interaction needs).

## How it Uses AI

The core of this project lies in the application of multi-agent AI systems through the CrewAI framework.
*   **Specialized Intelligence:** Each agent embodies a specific role with defined goals and tasks, simulating expert knowledge in its domain (Water Quality Analysis, Hydraulic Engineering, Hydrology, etc.).
*   **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Agents communicate and share information (implicitly or explicitly through the CrewAI framework) to solve complex, interdependent problems in water management. For example, the Water Quality Agent's findings might influence the Control Center's decisions on resource allocation, or the Flow Agent's detection of a leak could trigger actions from other agents.
*   **Task Automation and Analysis:** AI handles the processing of simulated data (water quality readings, flow rates, levels), performs analysis (trend identification, threshold comparison, optimization calculations), and generates reports or alerts.
*   **(Potential for Advanced AI):** The framework allows for integration with powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those provided by IBM watsonx.ai used in this project, for more sophisticated natural language understanding (in the Control Center agent), complex data interpretation, and predictive modeling.

This AI-driven approach enables more efficient, data-informed, and proactive water resource management compared to traditional methods.
